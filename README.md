# ReKodi
A cross platform desktop remote for Kodi/Xbmc build with Githubs awsome Electron framework.

The application is far from finished (lots of stuff isn't working or buggy) but a snapshot can be previewed bij downloading the appropriate installer from the following directory: https://github.com/sudo-systems/rekodi/tree/master/builds

Let me know what you think @ bram@sudo-systems.com! 
More information and screenshots will follow soon...
